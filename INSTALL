Installation Instructions for PySplot.

PySplot can be run from the commandline by typing the following if python points to python3:

python pysplot.py

If you have both python2.7 and python3 on your system you'll need to type:

python3 pysplot.py

On Linux/Mac:

You could put pysplot.py in your home directory, and add an alias to your commandline shell environment.

In bash you could use:  alias pysplot="python3 ~username/pysplot.py"


On windows I've just doen the commandline way from the anaconda prompt.

I have plans on building a Linux/Mac launcher.
