Installation Instructions for PySplot.

1. Running the python script, pysplot.py. Requires python and supporting libraries.
2. Standalone compiled version, contains python and all the libraries needed.

Standalone "compiled" versions can be downloaded here:  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/typny1czo7jrh8o/AACNHse9cJYSQ0-y5FOI963oa?dl=0

1. Running pysplot as a python script.

You just need the pysplot.py script.

PySplot can be run from the commandline by typing the following if python points to python3:

python pysplot.py

If you have both python2.7 and python3 on your system you'll need to type:

python3 pysplot.py

On Linux/Mac:

You could put pysplot.py in your home directory, and add an alias to your commandline shell environment.

In bash you could use:  alias pysplot="python3 ~username/pathtowhereyouputit/pysplot.py"


On windows I've just donr the commandline way from the anaconda prompt.

2. Standalone Compiled version.
Download just the compressed file for your system type (currently windows and linux only).  Mac version coming soon.

Windows:
Extract the files from the compressed archive.
This will create a pysplot folder.  Inside the folder are all the required libraries, and the executable file "pysplot.exe".
You can run the pysplot.exe from this folder or make a shortcut.  The first time you run it, it might download a missing library or two to itself (so may take a while to launch).  All launches after the first should be fairly quick on a modern computer.  The windows version has been tested on wine under linux and works.

Linux:
The compiled version is picky about the c-library your computer has.  I don't recommend this approach.
