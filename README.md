# pysplot
An IRAF-like tool for manipulating, and measuring 1-D FITS spectra.

PySplot is an interactive GUI program to plot and measure 1-D spectra in fits or text form. At this time fits tables are not supported well. The GUI makes use of several python libraries. I ran into distribution issues using a stand alone python script, so I have switched to provding compiled versions that are self contained. My main focus at present is the MacOS version, so the windows version tends to lag behind.

This program is very much still under development, feature requests are welcome, but understand I teach full time. This is my passion project and I hope for everyone to find it useful.
