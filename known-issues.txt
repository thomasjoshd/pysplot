saving fits not working, saves unreadable files, not sure what's going on
    Files read ok in ds9 now.  I can get pysplot to open headers with old method.
    can't figure out how to use the specutils metadata as astropy headers.


both issues below require  1-click....
  vel conversion not working (lets just have it ask for a number)
  align with 1 click not working. (same option as above?)


what is set height supposed to do?
