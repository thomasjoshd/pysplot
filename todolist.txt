#ToDoList

#have all measurement functions launch region selection instead of manually rerunning
#Try to rewrite all mouseclick_ functions so that it takes the number of clicks desired.
  #however there is an inconsistent used of mouseclick to not just get clicks but also launch
  #next steps, see about fixing this.
  #maybe have new replot function be called from plotSpectra (or wherever relevant)

#normalize during the eqw fitting, so spectra doesn't have to be normalized

#apply dopplershift (spectra.py), currently doesn't seem to work
  #are spectra being doppler shifted when opened?

#finish splitting off the stack functions into the stack.py class.

# package:
#https://gist.github.com/xypnox/35935d5de8a2e8574e60167bb8fdee56
    #add in the telluric-new.py functionality
    #add convolution by given profile. put this as a function in the sarith window?
    #cross correction
    #open echelle format spectra: hopeless?
    #open multispec/multiextension spectra.
    #create multiple lists?  list manager, as separate child window?

    #save animated gif
        #https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45852424/how-to-animate-a-function-in-matplotlib
    #set custom titles, labels
    #insert label text annotations
    #develop a way to sort the list on header keywords.
    #phase fold data for dynamical. and animation, needs a child window with:
        #Period, and T0
    #Stack Modify add:
        #linearize
        #linear shift
        #convert wavelength
    #add dropdown list of spectra to headerwin.
    #arith window * for all spectra in stack, also use in minilist delete and plot spectra.

#Stuff for big rewrite
    #can't open fits files saved from pysplot
    #finish adding status tips (though these don't seem to show on a mac, or linux.)
    #split fit function into separate functions. (save for big rewrite)
    #better display of line fitting. (longer term)
    #fit double gaussians (longer term, not for this release)
    #dynamical spectra, child window
